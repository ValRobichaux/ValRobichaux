- 👋 Hi, I’m @ValRobichaux
- 👀 I’m interested in everything related to web development and cybersecurity!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development using react!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything!


My name is Val Robichaux and I am a computer engineering major from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I am a mostly self taught programmer who loves learning new things like this for example!
CSS and HTML has been a very welcome change of pace for me. I love the experience of getting to do a lot of different jobs and having the experience to dive into something brand new! Like this, I also have experience in the unity game engine creating games with C#. My main strengths are really in C++ and C branches because that is where I learned all of my foundations for coding.

I am looking to expand my portfolio and resume by adding different kinds of fun coding projects that will further my career as a computer programmer! I constantly am looking for more and more experience in different fields, for example I have experience with data structures through my course work at A&M as well as basics of computer architechure. I love diving into new projects as it always presents me with a new learning opportunity. It doesn't take much decision making to decide on projects, as if I think it looks interesting I just get straight into it! I have always been a learner by doing, and getting to work on new projects and creating things as I go really excites me and gets me very passionate about my work.

On a more personal note, I am really passionate about making videos and trying to help others! I always thought that it was a great outlet to express my creativity as I like public speaking and leading others. I am really looking forward to making some tutorials over game development or coding development. A more personal side of me is that I really want to start a podcast or a talkshow because I have a lot of very creative ideas and I would love to have an outlet to share them with the world. Overall I really enjoyed this first project!
